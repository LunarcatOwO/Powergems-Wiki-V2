### Where can I get the resource pack?

Join the community Discord to find the latest pack.

### What are the default recipes?

Defaults are shown on the [Crafting](/overview/the-gems-and-their-ablities/crafting) page. Server owners can customize them.

### Is there a Bedrock edition pack?

Not officially. Community-made packs may exist on Discord; use at your own discretion.

### Where do I see all gem abilities?

See [The Gems and Their abilities](/overview/the-gems-and-their-ablities) for a full overview. Addons can extend abilities via the API.

### How can I add new gems or abilities?

Use the plugin’s API to add new content. Documentation will be expanded here.

### Is there a single “best” gem?

On a tuned server, balance should prevent a single best pick. Some configuration is expected.
