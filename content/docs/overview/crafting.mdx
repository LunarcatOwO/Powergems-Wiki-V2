The following recipes are the defaults and can be customized by server owners. For details on changing them, see [Configuration](/fundamentals/getting-set-up/configuration).

## Crafting a New Gem

Follow the default recipe shown below (or your customized variant in `recipes.yml`.).

Tip: If you changed the shape or materials in `recipes.yml`, update this page with your custom recipe so players know what to use.

## Upgrading Gems

Gems can be upgraded using a universal pattern by level. The exact materials per level are configurable.

Hint: Base cooldowns decrease with levels (see `cooldown.yml`) and `cooldownBoostPerLevelInSeconds`.
