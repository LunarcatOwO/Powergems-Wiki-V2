description: Key configuration options in config.yml and what they do.
---

Below is a paraphrased overview of notable options in `config.yml`. Names are shown in code for clarity.

### Basics

- `pluginPrefix`: Prefix text used for plugin messages in console/chat.
- `allowOnlyOneGem`: If true, restrict each player to a single gem.
- `canDropGems`: If false, players cannot drop gems.
- `giveGemOnFirstLogin`: If false, first-join gem gifting is disabled.
- `canUpgradeGems`: If false, gem upgrading is disabled.
- `canCraftGems`: If false, crafting new gems is disabled.
- `keepGemsOnDeath`: If false, gems drop when a player dies.
- `gemsHaveDescriptions`: If true, new gems include descriptive lore.

### Gameplay and safety

- `explosionDamageAllowed`: If false, destructive abilities are softened (reduced block damage).
- `preventGemPowerTampering`: If true, players canâ€™t interact with spawned projectiles or entities (e.g., no fireball deflects).
- `doGemDecay`: If true, on player death their gem level decreases by 1.
- `doDecayOnLevel1`: When `doGemDecay` is true, allow decay from level 1 (may destroy the gem).
- `dragonEggHalfCooldown`: If true, carrying a dragon egg halves gem cooldowns.
- `randomizedColors`: If true, gems can appear in randomized colors.

### Timing and performance

- `cooldownBoostPerLevelInSeconds`: Time reduced from ability cooldown per gem level.
- `delayToUseGemsOnJoin`: Seconds to wait before allowing gem use after login.
- `gemCreationAttempts`: Attempts to generate a valid gem before giving up (raise if many gems are disabled and users get none).
- `blockedReplacingBlocks`: Materials that abilities are not allowed to overwrite.
- `allowMovingGems`: Enable moving gems between containers (experimental/beta).
- `doDebuffForTemperature`: Apply debuffs when gem element clashes with environment temperature (e.g., ice in the Nether).

### Telemetry and updates

- `allowMetrics`: If true, sends anonymous usage stats to help improve the plugin.
- `runUpdater`: If true, notifies admins when updates are available.

### Limits and cosmetics

- `maxGemLevel`: Maximum level reachable via upgrades.
- `allowCosmeticParticleEffects`: If true, show ambient particles related to held gems.
- `cosmeticParticleEffectInterval`: Ticks between cosmetic particle spawns (lower = more frequent, potentially heavier).
- `gemCacheExpireTime`: How long to keep computed gem data cached (balance CPU vs. RAM usage).
