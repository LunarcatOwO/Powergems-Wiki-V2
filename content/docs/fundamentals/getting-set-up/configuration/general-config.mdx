</Callout>

### Basics

- `allowOnlyOneGem`: If true, restrict each player to a single gem.
- `canDropGems`: If false, players cannot drop gems.
- `giveGemOnFirstLogin`: If true, first-time players receive a random gem on their first join.
- `canUpgradeGems`: If false, gem upgrading is disabled.
- `canCraftGems`: If false, crafting new gems is disabled.
- `keepGemsOnDeath`: If false, gems drop when a player dies.
- `gemsHaveDescriptions`: If true, new gems include descriptive lore.

### Gameplay and safety

- `explosionDamageAllowed`: If false, destructive abilities are softened (reduced block damage).
- `preventGemPowerTampering`: If true, players can’t interact with projectiles or entities spawned by gems (e.g., no fireball deflects).
- `doGemDecay`: If true, when a player dies, their gem(s) lose 1 level.
- `doGemDecayOnLevel1`: When `doGemDecay` is true, allow decay from level 1 (will destroy the gem).
- `dragonEggHalfCooldown`: If true, carrying a dragon egg halves gem cooldowns.
- `randomizedColors`: If true, a gem’s displayed name color may be randomized (visual only).

### Timing and performance

- `cooldownBoostPerLevelInSeconds`: Time reduced from ability cooldown per gem level.
- `delayToUseGemsOnJoin`: Seconds to wait before allowing gem use after login.
- `gemCreationAttempts`: Attempts to generate a valid gem before giving up (raise if many gems are disabled and users get none).
- `blockedReplacingBlocks`: [Materials](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html) that abilities are not allowed to overwrite.
- `allowMovingGems`: Enable moving gems between containers (experimental).
- `doDebuffForTemperature`: Apply debuffs when gem element clashes with environment temperature (e.g., ice in the Nether).

### Telemetry and updates

- `allowMetrics`: If true, sends anonymous usage stats to help improve the plugin.
- `runUpdater`: If true, notifies admins when updates are available.
- `AA-ID`: Analytics identifier used for telemetry; do not change unless instructed.

### Diagnostics

- `debugMode`: If true, enables extra logging to help diagnose issues (may be noisy).

### Limits and cosmetics

- `maxGemLevel`: Maximum level reachable via upgrades.
- `allowCosmeticParticleEffects`: If true, show ambient particles related to held gems.
- `cosmeticParticleEffectInterval`: Ticks between cosmetic particle spawns (lower = more frequent, heavier).
- `gemCacheExpireTime`: How long to keep computed gem data cached (balance CPU vs. RAM usage).

### Progression and unlocks

- `unlockNewAbilitiesOnLevelX`: The level at which new abilities become available for a gem.
- `giveGemPermanentEffectOnLevelX`: If true, grants the gem’s permanent effect once the unlock level is reached.
- `unlockShiftAbilityOnLevelX`: If true, unlock the Shift ability at the configured unlock level.
- `upgradeGemOnKill`: If true, killing entities can upgrade/level up your gem.

### Integrations

- `isWorldGuardSupportEnabled`: If true, respects WorldGuard region flags for abilities.
- `isCombatLogXSupportEnabled`: If true, integrates with CombatLogX to prevent abuse during combat.

### Internationalization

- `languageCode`: Two-letter language code (e.g., `en`).
- `countryCode`: Two-letter country/region code (e.g., `US`).

### Maintenance and migration

- `attemptFixOldGems`: If true, attempts to auto-fix or migrate gems created by older plugin versions.
