If these files start nearly empty, trigger abilities in-game at least once to let the plugin populate them.

## recipes.yml

For advanced users. Define shaped recipes:

- Shape: rows of letters separated by commas.
- Ingredients: map letters to Bukkit material names (see the official Material list).

## cooldown.yml

Set the base cooldown (in seconds) for abilities at level 1. Higher levels reduce cooldown according to `cooldownBoostPerLevelInSeconds` in `config.yml`.

## activeGems.yml

Enable or disable specific gems server-wide.

## GemLore.yml

Controls the lore text applied to newly created gems.

## gemMaterials.yml

Set the visual/material used for each gem item (uses Bukkit Material names).
