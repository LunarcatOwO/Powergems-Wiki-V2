Before you begin, make sure your server supports plugins. We recommend [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/downloads/paper).

## Step 1: Download the plugin

- Get the latest release of the PowerGems plugin from the official source.

## Step 2: Install on your server

- Place the plugin JAR into your serverâ€™s `plugins/` directory.
- Start or restart the server.

## Step 3: Configure the plugin

- On first run, the plugin will generate configuration files.
- Tweak settings as needed; see [Configuration](/fundamentals/getting-set-up/configuration).
